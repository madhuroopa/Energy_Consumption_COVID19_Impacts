# Energy Consumption Impacts during COVID-19 in the USA

## Motivation

All environmental problems, such as greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and solid waste disposal, are directly linked to energy consumption. These issues are making our planet less habitable. Non-renewable energy resources are finite, and understanding their usage is crucial for transitioning to nuclear and renewable energy sources. Additionally, fluctuations in energy consumption due to factors like population growth and natural hazards, such as COVID-19, can be anticipated by analyzing past consumption trends.

## Goals

The purpose of this data analytics project is to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2020) has affected energy consumption trends in the United States, considering state-by-state population trends and the pandemic's timeline. The project also aims to identify patterns in the use of various energy resources, including nuclear, natural gas, renewable energy, electricity, coal, and petroleum.

## Intended Audience

This project is intended for:

- Policymakers planning to transition to sustainable energy resources.
- Academics researching the impact of the pandemic on energy usage.
- Individuals curious about how COVID-19 influenced energy consumption in the USA.
- Students and educators interested in learning about changes in US energy consumption trends.

## Data Sources

- Energy Consumption and Production data state-wise in the United States: [Link](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/)
- Population data state-wise in the United States: [Link](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/)

## Design Rationale

The design approach for this project follows data visualization principles of simplicity, clarity, and accuracy. The dashboard will cater to a wide range of users and feature:

- A simple and easy-to-navigate layout.
- Clear labeling and logical information flow.
- Color schemes and fonts to enhance visual appeal and readability.
- Key features such as time-series charts, geographic maps, interactive filters, and summary tables to highlight COVID-19's impact on energy consumption.

## Tools

- Python 3 (IDE: Google Colab) for data merging.
- Tableau for exploratory data analysis.
- Excel for 3D world maps.

## Insights

Key insights from this analysis include:

- A decrease in energy consumption in 2019-2020 compared to 2018.
- Decreased electricity and petroleum consumption in highly populated states such as Texas, California, New York, and Florida during 2019-2020.
- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 likely contributed to reduced electricity consumption in some areas as businesses and industries closed or reduced operations. Additionally, the decline in oil prices and the economic impact of the pandemic may have led to reduced petroleum consumption in the transportation sector.

Stay tuned for our detailed analysis and interactive visualizations!
